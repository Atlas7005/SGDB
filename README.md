# Steam Group Database (SGDB)

A database made for making browsing Steam groups easy.
## Usage

You can use it by checking out the Github [web page for it](https://steamgroups.com/) or by using the [API](https://atlasdev.stoplight.io/docs/steam-group-database).
## Extension
The Browser extension is made to help get more groups into the database.   
Whenever a user with the browser extension goes to a url like `https://steamcommunity.com/groups/atlassfans` it will send a request to the Database to add the Steam group.

If you want to support the project, you can install the extension [here](https://github.com/Atlas7005/SGDB/releases/latest).
